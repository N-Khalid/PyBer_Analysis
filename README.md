# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

V. Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

The purpose of the new analysis is compare riding sharing information regarding city types and determine how the data can be used to make decisions at the company

## Results:

When looking at the data regarding city types, urban and rural city types are found at opposite ends of each metric while the suburban city type is always located in the middle. We can see examples of this when looking at the following metrics:

Total rides: Urban city types have far and away the highest ride count with the rural city type having the lowest

Total Drivers: Urban city types have the most drivers actively providing services with the rural city type having the lowest

Total Fares: Due to having the most rides and drivers, the total fares collected in the urban city type is the highest of all of city types. On the opposite end,         rural is the lowest of the three city types

Average Fare per ride:  The highest average fare per ride is in the rural city type while it is lowest in the urban city type

Average fare per driver: The highest average fare per driver is in the rural city types while lowest in the urban city type

When viewing this graph we can determine the total fare by city type. The highest total fare is found in the urban city type followed by suburban and rural city types respectively. We can also see that between January to April all three city types see an increase in total fares. The lowest fares are always in January for all city types, and all three reach a peak in March and have a small decrease by April overall leading to the total increase over time.

## Summary:

Three business recommendations I have for the the CEO to address the disparities among the city types are:

1. Recruitment efforts should be strengthened in both rural and suburban areas as they may be affected the lack of drivers

3. Research the geography of rural and suburban areas to have more drivers stationed in more population-dense areas. Volume of drivers should be a priority in rural areas specifically due inaccessbility to drivers and potential length of rides

5. Continue to support the urban city type as it is the highest grossing segment of the business. This can be through marketing, recruiting more drivers and reward higher rated drivers
